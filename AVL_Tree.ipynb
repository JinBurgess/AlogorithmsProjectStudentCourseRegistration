    "The Student Registration System is designed to manage and prioritize student registration based on their major, year, and registration day. It employs an AVL (Adelson-Velsky and Landis) tree data structure to efficiently manage student registration and maintain a balanced order. This system can handle all students who identify as graduates, undergraduates, and auditors. The code will then return a panda dataframe of the admitted 25 students. \n",

    "**Design Choices**\n",
    "General: given the project, I assumed that this project did not allow the use of the built-in sorted function. \n",
    "\n",
    "A max heap which was used in previous iteration used a max-heap strucuture which had a worst case run time of O(n log n), nsertion and deletion in a max heap is O(log n), and retrieving the max or min has a time complexity of O(c).\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that the fastest worst case rune time of a sorting algorithm is O(n log n). Given that we had already had an almost complete max-heap and wanted to do a different type of algoritm with a similar runtime. That is why we chose an AVL-Tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "An AVL_Tree is a self-balancing binary tree. As new nodes are inserted and deleted, the tree updates it structure such that the height of the left subtree and right subtree are similar. Thus, the difference is between -1 and 1. This tree rebalancing ensures that different operations such as inserting, deletion, and look up runs in worst-case(log n).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another aspect what was used better in this project was the class system such that it is more object-oriented.\n",
    "\n",
    "We maintained the priority queue done from Sabrina's homework code in inserting student.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Caveat to AVL_Tree:*\n",
    "This was used as a gymnastic mental exercise to make an AVL_Tree work for a priority queue. Overall, a heap structure would be better for this situation because it uses less meemory, it is compentitionally less complicated, and runtime of an unbalanced heap structure still runs in O(n log n)."

    "**Implementation**\n",
    "The python language is an object-orientated programming language which relies on classes and objects to simplify code and reuse code chuncks. There are three classes Node, AVL_Tree, and stud_registration. The Node class defines the attributes of a node instance. The AVL_Tree contains all the functions related to maintaining the AVL structure and method to update strucutre when new students are added. The stud_registration acts like the middle man between the actions below code: if __name__ == \"__main__\": and the AVL_Tree class and Node class. "

When this happens, the code  cannot iterate through the tree via the priority.

Because the student name is not a valid method of iteration, we need to determine another way to get the location of the student within the tree.
