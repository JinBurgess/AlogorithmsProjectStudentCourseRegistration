## Introduction

The Student Registration System is designed to manage and prioritize student registration based on their major, year, and registration day. It employs an AVL (Adelson-Velsky and Landis) tree data structure to efficiently manage student registration and maintain a balanced order. This system can handle all students who identify as graduates, undergraduates, and auditors.

## Overview
Create an algorithm that takes in a students and order them based off thier prioirty in order to determine who will be admitted into the Fall semester graduate course for Data Science. Enrollment is limited to 25 students and graduate students, undergraduate students, and auditors are eligible to apply for a place in the class. The algorithms will be able to update for students who are added and those who drop the course. 

## Prioritization Logic
1. Graduate students are given priority for enrollment, assuming they register by the end of orientation week.
   
3. Undergraduates are given second priority and amongst undergraduates.
    - priority is determined by whether the student is majoring in CS and/or math, what year they are in, and what day of orientation (1-5 inclusive) they register, in that order.
      
4. Auditors are permitted assuming there remain open seats, and priority is determined by what day of orientation (1-5 inclusive) they apply.
   
6. If any admitted student drops the class before the end of the second week of class, the open position is offered to the most qualified person who was not previously offered a place in the class.

## Dependencies

This program requires the following Python libraries:

- `numpy` (aliased as `np`)
- `pandas` (aliased as `pd`)
- `random`

Make sure you have these libraries installed to run the program successfully.

## Structure

The program consists of two main classes, `Node` and `AVL_Tree`, as well as a class `stud_registration` to manage the student registration process.

## Key Classes
### `class Node`

The `Node` class represents a node in the AVL tree, which stores information about each student's registration and priority. It contains the following attributes:

- `name`: Student's name.
- `major`: Student's major.
- `year`: The year the student is in.
- `reg_day`: The day of registration.
- `priority`: Priority value used for comparison-based analysis to develop priority.
- `left`: Reference to the left child node.
- `right`: Reference to the right child node.
- `height`: Height of the node in the tree, used for tree balancing.

### `class AVL_Tree`

The `AVL_Tree` class represents the AVL tree structure and contains methods for managing the tree. It includes the following methods:

- `tree_height(self, node)`: Calculates the height of a given subtree.
- `left_left_rotation(self, node)`: Performs a left-left rotation to rebalance the tree.
- `right_right_rotation(self, node)`: Performs a right-right rotation to rebalance the tree.
- `left_right_rotation(self, node)`: Performs a left-right rotation to rebalance the tree.
- `right_left_rotation(self, node)`: Performs a right-left rotation to rebalance the tree.
- `insert(self, parent_node, name, major, year, reg_day, priority)`: Inserts a new student into the AVL tree based on priority.
- `find_min(self, node)`: Finds the node with the minimum priority in a given subtree, used in deletion.
- `delete_node(self, node, identifier)`: Deletes a student node from the tree by unique identifier.
- `set_identifier(self, node, N, name_to_identifier)`: Assigns unique identifiers to nodes for efficient deletion.
- `print_tree(self, node, admitted_students, max_students)`: Populates a list with students in descending order of priority.

### `class stud_registration`

The `stud_registration` class manages the student registration process. It contains the following methods:

- `student_priority(self, major, year, reg_day)`: Calculates the priority value for a student based on major, year, and registration day.
- `register_student(self, name, year, reg_day, major)`: Registers a student in the AVL tree if they registered within the orientation period.
- `remove_student(self, name, identifier)`: Removes a student from the AVL tree by their unique identifier.
- `get_student_dataframe(self, max_students)`: Retrieves a DataFrame of admitted students with a specified maximum count.
- Initialization: Creates an instance of the AVL tree to manage student registration.

## Usage

The program's main functionality can be executed in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block at the end of the script. It demonstrates how to use the `stud_registration` class to register, remove, and retrieve student data.

## Example Data Generation

The program generates random student data for testing purposes. You can change the number of students generated by modifying the `num_students` variable. The generated data includes random names, years, registration days, and majors.

```python
random_students = [generate_random_student() for _ in range(num_students)]
```

## Remove a Student

To remove a student, you can use the `remove_student` method by specifying the student's name and unique identifier.

```python
random.seed(101)

x = admitted.sample(n = 3, replace = False)
print(x)

for indx in range(len(x)):
    stud = x._get_value(indx, 0, takeable = True) # gets student name from the sample 
    identifier = name_to_identifier[stud] # finds the identifer that is attached to the student
    reg_stud.remove_student(identifier) # remove student based of their identifier
```

## Get Admitted Students

You can retrieve a DataFrame of admitted students with a specified maximum count by using the `get_student_dataframe` method.

```python
admitted = reg_stud.get_student_dataframe()
print(admitted)
```

This program provides a foundation for managing student registration and maintaining a priority list based on various criteria. You can further adapt and extend it for specific use cases and requirements.
